    <h2>How to make a yummy haitian pattie</h2>
    <p>A <strong>pattie</strong> in itself is any item of food covered with dough or batter and fried or baked.</p>
    <p>The only thing that makes a Haitian pattie different from the others is the ingredients in it and most often, it's fried.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
     <ul> 
      <li>All purpose flour </li>
      <li>Eggs</li>
      <li>Water</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>Cooking oil</li>
      <li>Cabbage,Onions,tomatoes,bell peppers </li>
      <li>Seasoning</li>
      <li>Herring</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
     <ol>
         <h4>Prepare the dough</h4>
      <li>Add the flour in a large bowl.</li>
      <li>Add the water and oil</li>
      <li>Knead the dough until just combined</li>
      <li>Roll into a small log</li>
      <li>Cut the dough into 4 even pieces.You can make the patties as big or small as youâ€™d like. We cut our dough into 4 pieces.</li>
      <li>Working with one piece at a time, flatten the dough. Use a rolling pin if necessary </li>
      <li>Add a spoonful or a forkful spoon of the filling to the center of the dough. Fold one half of the dough over to the meat the other half</li>
      <li>Press down with your finger firmly, then seal the dough with the back of the fork. Pierce the dough a few time. This will help the dough to cook evenly and allow air to pass through as it cooks.</li>
